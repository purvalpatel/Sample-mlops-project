MLOps:
MLOps is set of practices at the intersection of Machine learning, Devops and data engineering aimed at deploying ML systems
in production reliably and efficiently.

In Devops there is predictability in pipeline deployment. but in ML Models are unpredictable.

1. Bridges developement and operations
2. Standardize the ML Lifecycle
3. Automates repetative tasks
4. Enable reproducibilty and governance.

Importance of MLOps:
1. CICD
2. Orchestration and automation
3. Monitoring and management

MLops Core practices:
1. Version everything
    a) Code, data, models, configs
2. Automate pipelines ( with same tools )
    a) Training, testing, deployment
3. Track experiaments
    a) Parameters, mertics, artifacts
4. Monitor  ( this is different from others)
    a) Performance
5. Enable Governance
    a) Documentation and compliance.

Life cycle of ML Project:

Data -> Model -> Inference (Production) -> Monitoring -> re-training
